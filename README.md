# DLLFormat

This is a simple project which lets me organize information into a tree format, save it to a file, and load it back in for more viewing and editing.

I made this project to help me organize information that I had been previously keeping in my head.

To run this program, simply clone the repo (or copy/paste the main.py file) and run it with python 3. The program implements a shell, and you can use 'help' to get a list of all possible commands.

Example:
